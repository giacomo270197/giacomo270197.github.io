I am Giacomo and I currently work as a security analyst. I studied Computer Science (BSc) at the University of Groningen and Security and Network Engineering (MSc) at the University of Amsterdam.

I mean to use this blog as a way to keep track of my (mostly security related) projects and experiments. Hopefully, writing about what I do will help me understand it a bit better and will push me not to leave eveything half-done as I go about chasing new ideas. And if anyone finds any of this useful, that's even better.

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/giacomo-casoni) or via [email](mailto:gcasoni@hotmail.it).
