I am Giacomo. I work as a security analyst, and I studied Computer Science (BSc) and Security and Network Engineering (MSc).

I mean to use this blog as a way to keep track of my (mostly security related) projects and experiments. Hopefully, writing about what I do will help me understand it a bit better and will push me not to leave eveything half-done as I go about chasing new ideas. And if anyone finds any of this useful, that's even better.

You can find me on Linkedin or via email.
